### About Me

---

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/bookmark_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/bookmark_gray.svg" width="40px" /> I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Engineering and double majoring in Mathematics at Korea University. I previously conducted research as an intern at the [**Multimodal Interactive Intelligence Laboratory (MIIL)**](https://miil.korea.ac.kr/), under the supervision of [**Prof. Paul Hongsuck Seo**](https://phseo.github.io/). My research interests lie in multimodal generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches for cross-modal alignment, synthesis, and understanding. I am currently focused on **generative modeling in the video domain**, exploring how temporal dynamics and multimodal signals can be jointly modeled within modern deep learning frameworks.
